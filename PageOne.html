				<p>This website was born from a love of horses.  Memories of a young girl getting up before dawn to go for a ride with her Dad. 
				We will show you some of the beautiful ranches in America and provide links for amazing places to ride.

				<li>The first one we will talk about is <a href="http://alisal.com/">Alisal Ranch.</a>  Nestled in the rolling hills just outside of Solvang in Southern California.  
				Once famous for it's Hollywood visitors, you feel like you are back in time when you visit this quaint ranch.  You can also play tennis, golf, and go fishing in between your rides. 
				</li>
				<li>Next let's look at <a href="https://redhorsemountainranch.com/">Red Horse Mountain Ranch.</a>  This beautiful place is near Coeur d'Alene, Idaho.  Red Horse Mountain Ranch is known for its guided adventures that reawaken the spirit.
				The Ranch provides adventures such as the high ropes and challenge course, kayaking tours, miles of scenic trails, kids' program, horseback trail rides, fly fishing, as well as countless other seasonal activities.
				</li>
				<li>Now let's look at <a href="http://www.theranchatrockcreek.com/">The Ranch at Rock Creek.</a>
				The Ranch at Rock Creek is the world's only Forbes Travel Guide Five-Star guest ranch. A Relais & Chateaux property, this all-inclusive luxury guest ranch brings 
				together upscale amenities and wide open spaces like never before.  Because what cowgirl doesn't want a nice glass of wine at the end of a ride.
				</li>
				<li>Now one from Colorado <a href="http://www.vistaverde.com/">Vista Verde Guest Ranch.</a>
				Vista Verde Ranch offers a wide array of summer activities like many Colorado ranch resorts, but what sets us apart is the flexibility and personalization that goes into each experience. 
				And, unlike a resort, we're still a just a ranch with down to earth people who treat you like family. September is our favorite month in the summer. It is adult only and such a beautiful time of year! 
				Christmas is also very magical in a totally different way. It's just what Christmas should be.
